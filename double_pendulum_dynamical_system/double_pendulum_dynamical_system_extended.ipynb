    "# The Double Pendulum: Model, Equations, and Dynamical Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The double pendulum is one of the simplest mechanical systems that exhibits **deterministic chaos**. Despite being governed by classical Newtonian mechanics and fully deterministic equations of motion, its long-term behavior is highly sensitive to initial conditions. This makes it a paradigmatic example in nonlinear dynamics, classical mechanics, and chaos theory. At its core, the double pendulum consists of two point masses connected by rigid, massless rods and constrained to move in a vertical plane under the influence of gravity. What distinguishes it from the simple pendulum is the **nonlinear coupling** between its degrees of freedom, which destroys integrability and gives rise to complex, aperiodic motion.\n",
